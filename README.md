# Google GitHub Actions - Example Workflows

Test
55

This repository holds several references to example workflows and demonstrates how to use the Google GitHub Actions for common scenarios. Each action should be represented as a sub-folder under the `workflows` folder in this repository, e.g. the `workflows/auth` folder will hold examples for the `google-github-actions/auth` action.
